# posts

Archive of blog posts for personal site and platforms.

> Start here copy elsewhere.

Create a named folder with the markdown file and an empty folder for `images`

## Links

Blog to Blog Links are left relative to the project. These links will need to be updated based on the platform copied to.(Medium to Medium links)

## Images

Images should be downloaded and kept in case a 3rd party goes down or you move your personal storage without thinking.

If using another creators image (_ie Free Downloads from Upsplash_), the reference should be mentioned in the post istself.

**NOTE:** A raw github url is used for the image to allow for future migration of markdown files.

Example: If I copy this post to Medium and Dev.to - the photo links will already be set and documented.
Copying over to a DB for a personal blog. Good. To. Go. :+1:
