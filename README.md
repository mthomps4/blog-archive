Archive of blog posts for personal site and platforms.

> Start here copy elsewhere.

Uses Hygen to generate the folder structure needed/wanted.

- `yarn`
- `yarn new myPostName`

This will create a named folder with the markdown file and an empty folder for `images`

## Series Organization
If building a series follow this pattern for naming more markdown files within the same folder.
`main_series_title-sub_title.md`

Later this can be reformatted if ever being transitioned to another platform

Example:
`up_and_running-next_and_typeorm.md`

We known this title should be something like
> Up and Running: Next and Typeorm

The `-` can be transformed to `:` and ran through `titleize`


## Links
Blog to Blog Links are left relative to the project. These links will need to be updated based on the platform copied to.

## Images
Images should be downloaded and kept in case a 3rd party goes down or you move your personal storage without thinking.

If using another creators image (_ie Free Downloads from Upsplash_), the reference should be mentioned in the post istself.

**NOTE:** A raw github url is used for the image to allow for future migration of markdown files.

Example: If I copy this post to Medium and Dev.to - the photo links will already be set and documented.
Copying over to a DB for a personal blog. Good. To. Go. :+1:
