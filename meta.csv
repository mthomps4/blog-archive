GraphQL the Dev Edition,"It’s difficult to be a developer and not experience the hype around GraphQL. I’ve spent the last three years implementing GraphQL APIs in Elixir and Node, watching the tooling and community grow along the way.

Rolling Your Team RPG Style,"As hard as it is for some people to believe, developers are not robots, we are human beings. Even harder to believe, we each have unique personalities. Some days it feels like we are in a bad enterprise commercial. We each speak to our own “sport”, explaining that we actually did(do) something else with our lives besides stare at code all day and manage expectations.",10/21/2019,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mthomps4/blog-posts/master/posts/rolling_your_team_rpg_style/rolling_your_team_rpg_style.md,,,,,,
Up and Running: Zeit and Now,"If you’re a JavaScript developer you’ve probably heard mention of zeit.co / Now and all their plans to have a zero-config setup for app deployments.

Remote Workers: Help Your Neighbor,"Friends and organizations are being forced into work environments with little to no warning, using tools and resources we take for granted on a daily. While there may be a dedicated IT guy on staff most places do not have that person. Those who do suddenly got overwhelmed with the scale of requests. “Hey, I need 20 laptops by tomorrow…”. Below is a quick example of how we can take our day-to-day knowledge and reach out to those in need.",03/17/2020,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mthomps4/blog-posts/master/posts/remote_workers/help_your_neighbor.md,,,,,,
Hyper Focused -> Hyper Productive,"Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been ramping up on Rails and read multiple articles pertaining to Elixir, Phoenix 1.5, and LiveView. I was excited, passionate, renewed even. Ready to dive into a new build and write a series of content. Except for some reason I couldn’t do it.
